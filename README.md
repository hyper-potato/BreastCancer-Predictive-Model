# BreastCancer-Predictive-Model

Specifically, build decision tree, k-NN techniques, logistic regression and SVM (explore how well model performs for several different hyper-parameter values). Present a brief overview of your predictive modeling process, explorations, and discuss your results. Make sure you present information about the model “goodness” (possible things to think about: confusion matrix, predictive accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure). Briefly discuss ROC and lift curves.

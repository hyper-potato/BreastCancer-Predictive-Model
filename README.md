# BreastCancer-Predictive-Model

Specifically, build a decision tree, logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors that predicts the diagnose result based on ten real-valued features (mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest of these features). 

Explore how well different model perform for several different parameter values. 

Show how you set the model that provides the best predictive performance.   
Present a brief overview of your predictive modeling process, explorations, and discuss your results. 
Make sure you present information about the model “goodness”.
